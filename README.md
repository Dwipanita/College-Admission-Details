Exploratory Data Analysis and Principal Component Analysis on College Admission Details

The dataset Education - Post 12th Standard.csv contains information on various colleges. You are expected to do a Principal Component Analysis for this case study according to the instructions given. The data dictionary of the 'Education - Post 12th Standard.csv' can be found in the following file: Data Dictionary.xlsx.

•	Perform Exploratory Data Analysis. What insight do you draw from the EDA?

•	Is scaling necessary for PCA in this case? Give justification and perform scaling.

•	Comment on the comparison between the covariance and the correlation matrices from this data [on scaled data].

•	Check the dataset for outliers before and after scaling. What insight do you derive here? 

•	Extract the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

•	Perform PCA and export the data of the Principal Component (eigenvectors) into a data frame with the original features

•	Write down the explicit form of the first PC (in terms of the eigenvectors

•	Consider the cumulative values of the eigenvalues. How does it help you to decide on the optimum number of principal components? What do the eigenvectors indicate?

•	Explain the business implication of using the Principal Component Analysis for this case study. How may PCs help in the further analysis?
